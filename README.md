# Rate Shelf

This is an application that allows users to create and share book profiles as well as rating other user's posts. Users can also filter the books by category.

*I have essentially based my code on the Ryan Hemrick's [GitHub](https://github.com/RyanHemrick/Book-Review) and [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyJtAEU4pGw3PCKAA4POHK6C2G2nnpLF).* 

## Requirements
- Ruby 2.6.3
- Rails 5.2.3
- Sqlite3

## Setup
To get the application running, follow the steps below:
`bundle install`

After this, you should run:
`rails db:create
`rails db:migrate`

Then run the app locally with:
`rails s`
